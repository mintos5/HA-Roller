# HA-Roller

## my personal forked version:


- Version with a lot weaker ULN2003 stepper:
- One ESP is controllinh 2 steppers with the help of the ESPHome Packages
- be careful with the PIN bindings, this was working on one dev board and not in another
    - needs more testing from my side

![Home Assistant](https://github.com/R34LiAM/HA-Roller/blob/main/pcb/HA.png?raw=true)


Integrates with:

+ Home Assistant through ESPHome integration.

+ MQTT (HomeKit/HomeBridge and more).

+ HTTP Requests/REST API.

+ Standalone w/o home automation integration.

+ plus more


Should integrate with pretty much anything...
